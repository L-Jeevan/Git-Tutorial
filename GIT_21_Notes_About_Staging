What Does "Stage a File" Mean in Git?
Staging a file means telling Git:

"Hey, I’m ready to include this specific change in the next version (commit)."

🧠 Git Has Three Areas:
Working Directory – where you make changes

Staging Area – where you prepare changes

Repository (Commit) – where changes are saved as versions

🔁 Real-World Analogy:
Think of Git like packing for a trip:

Working Directory: Your room with clothes lying around.

Staging Area: Your suitcase (you choose what to pack).

Commit: You zip the suitcase and it's ready to go.

So when you use git add, you're putting clothes (changes) into your suitcase (staging area).
When you run git commit, you zip the suitcase and lock it as a version.

🧪 Example:
vim notes.txt          # Edit file
git status             # Git sees the file is changed
git add notes.txt      # You stage the file (prepare it)
git commit -m "Added new points to notes.txt"   # You save it as a version
